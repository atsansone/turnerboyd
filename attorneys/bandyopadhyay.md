For over a decade, Esha has been practicing intellectual property and technology-related commercial litigation and counseling in the Bay Area, with a primary focus on patent disputes. Esha has successfully represented companies ranging in size from Fortune 100 to emerging start-ups, as well as individual inventors, in high-stakes litigation. Esha&#8217;s patent litigation engagements have involved diverse industries such as wireless standards, optical character recognition, image processing, anti-virus and encryption software, social media, photo-sharing, medical devices, and various consumer products. Esha also has significant experience with trade secret disputes in high-tech industries, and has litigated numerous copyright, trademark, Internet, and false advertising matters. 

Prior to joining Turner Boyd, Esha was a partner at Kirkland &#038; Ellis LLP. Earlier in her career, Esha was an associate at Wilson, Sonsini Goodrich &#038; Rosati, and Of Counsel at Perkins Coie. Each year from 2007 through 2011, Esha was selected to the Northern California Super Lawyers "Rising Star" list in Intellectual Property Litigation, a distinction awarded to less than 2.5% of Northern California lawyers under the age of 40. 

Esha received her law degree in 2000 from the University of California, Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall). She received her B.A. in Economics, with highest departmental distinction, in 1996 from the University of California, San Diego. At the age of 18, she was the youngest graduate in the history of the university. During her year between college and law school, Esha worked as an Economic Analyst.

In addition to practicing law, Esha is an exponent of Odissi dance (Indian classical dance from the state of Odisha), and performs extensively throughout the U.S. and abroad. Her performances range from solo full-length shows to collaborations with established dance troupes in the U.S. and India. In 2012, she was involved in "East Meets West", a limited engagement collaboration with Cirque du Soleil in Las Vegas.
