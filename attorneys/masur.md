Joshua Masur has practiced intellectual property litigation and general business litigation for technology companies for over a decade. Mr. Masur represents clients in federal and state trial and appeals courts, before the International Trade Commission, and in private mediation and arbitration. His experience spans such disparate technologies as semiconductor chip design, hyperlinks, memory controllers, streaming online video, automotive pollution controls, user interfaces, WiFi antennas, encryption, biometric authentication, and type fonts. Mr. Masur also has particular expertise in intellectual property indemnification disputes.

From 2008 to 2010, Mr. Masur served as the president of the San Francisco Bay Area Intellectual Property American Inn of Court, the premier organization in Northern California dedicated to fostering skills, professionalism, collegiality, and ethics among the intellectual property bench and bar. He is a member of the American Intellectual Property Law Association and several of its committees, including the Committee on Patent Litigation and subcommittees on the Model Patent Jury instructions, Confidentiality in Litigation, and Pleading Standards. Northern California SuperLawyers named Mr. Masur a "Rising Star" in 2009 and a "SuperLawyer" from 2011 to the present. Mr. Masur does not know exactly why he received a perfect 10.0 Avvo Rating, but he isn't complaining about it.

Mr. Masur received his J.D. in 1999 from Columbia Law School, where he was an Articles Editor of the Columbia-VLA Journal of Law & The Arts and was named a James Kent Scholar and a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar.
