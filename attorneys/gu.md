Ms. Gu specializes in intellectual property counseling and litigation, with a focus on patent litigation. Ms. Gu began her legal career in 2006 as an intellectual property associate at Perkins Coie LLP’s Menlo Park office. While at Perkins Coie, she worked on both patent litigation and prosecution cases for clients ranging from Fortune 100 corporations to individual inventors. After leaving Perkins Coie in 2008, Ms. Gu continued representing major international corporations such as Samsung and IBM on patent litigation matters in both federal district courts and the International Trade Commission. Her patent experiences, both in prosecution and litigation, involved a broad scope of technologies such as semiconductor processing, secure internet transactions, cryptography, GPS navigation, image processing, silicon heat treatments, printer data processing, flash memory fabrication, and compressor wheel manufacturing processes.

Ms. Gu was a Chancellor’s scholar at the University of California, Berkeley while studying for a B.S. degree in Electric Engineering and Computer Science. Prior to attending law school at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, Ms. Gu worked as a patent agent after passing the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s registration exam. While attending law school, she worked on the Hastings Communication and Entertainment Law Journal and summered as a patent associate at Dewey Ballantine LLP, Perkins Coie LLP, and Howrey LLP.
