Robert Kent’s practice emphasizes intellectual property litigation, with a focus on patent litigation. Robert has worked for both plaintiffs and defendants, at all stages of the patent litigation process, from pre-filing investigations, to discovery and to motion practice, to jury trial. Robert has addressed specialized patent litigation topics such as claim construction proceedings and infringement and invalidity contentions in many cases, as well as technical expert discovery.

Mr. Kent’s legal practice is informed by four years of industry experience in computer science, including positions in both software engineering and customer-facing technical advising. During Mr. Kent’s time in industry, he gained expertise in a wide variety of industry standard languages and tools. This expertise has infused Robert’s practice, not only with the deep knowledge necessary to conduct thorough infringement and invalidity investigations, but also with the ability to come up to speed quickly and work efficiently with state of the art technologies.

Mr. Kent’s cases have spanned a wide range of technologies both within the computer science domain and in other areas, including network data processing, databases, digital imaging, DRAM memory devices, high speed digital signaling, plasma-based carbon deposition, solar panel mounting devices, mobile application security, and cellular phone cases.  Mr. Kent has represented clients in California state courts, federal courts for the Northern District of California, the District of Colorado, the District of Massachusetts, the District of Delaware, and the International Trade Commission.

Prior to joining Turner Boyd, Mr. Kent was an associate with Fish & Richardson.
