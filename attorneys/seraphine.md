Jennifer Seraphine has represented clients in intellectual property matters for over 15 years. She has litigated patent, trademark, and copyright infringement cases, as well as cases involving claims of unfair competition, deceptive trade practices, and theft of trade secrets and enforcement of covenants not to compete. Jennifer has participated in patent infringement litigations involving the now ubiquitous Blackberry device, technology for the downloading of music samples on the Internet, equipment used in the manufacture of semiconductor chips, and the shopping cart metaphor and payment systems for online sales. Jennifer has also handled trademark infringement matters involving the marks of a major Russian bank, a popular Manhattan nightclub and "Ting," a grapefruit-flavored soda popular in the Caribbean. She has also handled copyright infringement matters including one case involving the alleged on-line copying of timely financial information by the Singapore branch of a major German banking institution that implicated the 1908 Supreme Court "hot news" doctrine.

Before joining Turner Boyd LLP, Ms. Seraphine was a partner in the intellectual property group at Jones Day, where she practiced in the New York and San Francisco offices beginning in 2001 through 2011; an associate with Feldman Gale, a boutique IP firm in Miami, Florida; and law clerk to the Honorable Wilkie D. Ferguson of the Southern District of Florida (1995-1997). She also spent time prosecuting criminal cases for the San Francisco District Attorneyâ€™s Office.
